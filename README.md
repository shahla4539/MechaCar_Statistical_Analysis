Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

There are a number of metrics produced from the t.test()function, but for now we will only concern ourselves with the calculated p-value. Assuming our significance level was the common 0.05 percent, our p-value is above our significance level. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we would state that the two means are statistically similar.Due to random sampling, your sample dataset may differ from our example and thus your calculations may be different. Therefore, you'll need to compare your calculated p-value to your own significance level. If your p-value is lower than the significance level, you would have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and state that the two means are statistically different.
